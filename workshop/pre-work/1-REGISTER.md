### Step 3: [Login into IBM Cloud](https://ibm.biz/Bd2JHx) using your account credentials.

_Note:_ By default, all new IBM Cloud accounts are set to a [lite version](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/pricing).

The lite account provides free access to a subset of IBM Cloud resources. Lite accounts **don't need a credit-card** to sign up and they **don't expire** after a certain period of time. 
In order to create a free Kubernetes cluster, you need a **feature code**.
