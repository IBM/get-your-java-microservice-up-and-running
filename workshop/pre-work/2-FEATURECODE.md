# Apply your feature code

In order to execute the workshop easily, we provide **feature codes** to create free Kubernetes clusters, so no credit card details are required.
To apply the feature code to your [Cloud Account](https://cloud.ibm.com/account), navigate to your "`Account settings`" and then to ("`Manage`" -> "`Account`").
Enter your unique Feature (Promo) Code to upgrade your `Lite Account` to a `Trial Account`.

_Note:_ Free clusters expire after one month.
