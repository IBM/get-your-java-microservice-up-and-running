# Workshop: Get your Java Microservice up and running

This workshop demonstrates how to build a Microservice with Java and how to deploy it to Kubernetes on the IBM Cloud. The Microservice in this workshop is kept as simple as possible, so that it can be used as a starting point for other Microservices. The Microservice has been developed with Java EE and [Eclipse MicroProfile](https://microprofile.io/).

## What's a Microservice

There are small variations of microservice definitions out there, here is one definition of [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/microservice):

* > A microservice is a service-oriented application component that is tightly scoped, strongly encapsulated, loosely coupled, independently deployable and independently scalable.

* > [More additional information related to microservices provided by IBM.](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/microservices)

## Architecture

In the gif below you see the Authors Microservice, which we will run locally in a Docker container.
We will deploy this Authors Microservice to Kubernetes on IBM Cloud.
The gif shows the steps of exercise 3 how we deploy that Microservice to IBM Cloud.

## Objectives

After you complete this workshop, you'll understand the following topics:

* Java implementation of a Cloud Native RESTFul Java Microservice built on open technologies MicroProfile and OpenLiberty.
* Describe how to effectively build and run a Microservice on a local machine in a container
* Understands the steps needed to deploy a single Microservice to Kubernetes and on the IBM Cloud Kubernetes service

You can verify your learning in the **Cloud Native Starter Badge - Level 1**

> To be prepared to pass the test of the [**Cloud Native Starter Badge - Level 1**](http://ibm.biz/cloud-native-starter-level-1-badge), you should run the hands-on workshop **virtual** or **face to face**, but you can also run the workshop as a **self service**.
